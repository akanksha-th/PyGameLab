# PyGameLab
Just having fun with Pygame! ðŸŽ® Learning by building one small game per dayâ€”some might be cool, some might be weird, but all are part of the journey.

Below is a brief description of each project along with key takeaways from the development process.
### 1. DotDash
Description:
A simple game where a circle moves across the screen using the WASD keys. The game introduces basic movement mechanics.

What I Learned:
    How to draw objects (like circles) on the screen using Pygame.
    How to display text on the screen.
